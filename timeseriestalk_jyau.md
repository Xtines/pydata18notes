Time Series Forecasting using Statistical and Machine Learning Models: When and How
============================================================================
by Jeffrey Yau, October 17 2018

### Description
Time series forecasting techniques are applied in a wide range of scientific disciplines, business scenarios, and policy settings. This presentation discuss the applications of statistical time series models, such as ARIMA, VAR, and Regime Switching Models, and machine learning models, such as random forest and neural network-based models, to forecasting problems.

### Abstract
Time series data is ubiquitous: daily term structure of interest rates, tick level stock prices, daily foreign currency exchange rates, weekly initial unemployment claim, monthly company sales, daily foot traffic recorded by mobile devices, and daily number of steps taken recorded by a wearable, just to name a few.

Some of the most important and commonly used data science techniques in time series forecasting are those developed in the field of statistics and machine learning. A few basic time series statistical and machine learning modeling techniques for forecasting should be included in any data scientistâ€™s toolkit.

This presentation discusses the application of statistical and machine learning models in real-world time series forecasting. Statistical models covered include Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Model, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model, and Regime Switching Models, and machine learning models covered include Tree-based models and Neural Network-based models. I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages when using each of these models in time series forecasting scenarios. Real-world applications, demonstrated using jupyter notebooks, are used throughout the presentation to illustrate these techniques. While not the focus in this presentation, exploratory time series data analysis will also be included in the presentation.

This presentation is suitable for data scientists who have working knowledge of the classical linear regression model and a basic understanding of univariate time series models, such as the class of Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models, and machine learning techniques.

### Models

1. naive, rule-based model

2. "Rolling" average model

3. more sophisticated models

*Forecasting*: predicting future values of the series using current set of info


  
#### ARMA Autoregressive Moving Average Model

Future value Y(t+H) is a function of previous Yis and a series of "shocks" or error terms.


#### ARIMA model/ Univariate statiscal time series models

An ARIMA model is ARMA applied/extended to a non-stationary series. 

- statistical relationship is uni-directional
  - the future is a function of the past


#### Seasonal ARIMA model

- applied to non-stationary series only
- auto-covariates only a function of the time-lag
